Every line you write has the potential to conflict with every other line. Because of this, CSS is often the hardest part of scaling any Web application or working on a development team.</p><p>In my article published on the <a href=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/css-everything-is-global-and-how-to-deal-with-it.html>Adobe Developer Network</a>, I discuss some strategies for dealing with the global nature of CSS.
